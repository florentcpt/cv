\cvsection{Objectives}

\\\\
My past experiences learned me some things.\\
The application layer can not work without a strong and well designed system underneath but this later one do not have any sense without any application running on it.\\
Thus, I strongly believe that developers and system administrators worlds must merge at some point.\\
Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity that give me the chance to bring up my expertise of those two worlds to break the boundary existing between them.\\
\\
As an IT lover, I spend a lot of time discovering and leveraging new things. \\
Some of my free time is then dedicated to open my mind on technologies or languages I heard about to become the more objective as possible when needing to take a decision on my professional life. \\
Thus, apart the different technologies I worked on, I manage to have a great overview of the market. \\
\\
Some of words that are well defining my mindset are: curious, innovative, proactive and autonomous. \\
